 * contributors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As a workaround, if all the elements in a structured selection implement IEEFTabbedPropertySheetPageContributor and
 * they all return the same unique contributor ID, then that configuration of tabs and sections will be used by the
 * tabbed property view for that selection.
